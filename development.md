> Notes for developers

This project's title above was named to exclude GraphQL and Python, as those are implementation details.

Using `-py` in the repo name helps to match a convention and to distinguish from my similar projects.

The project was renamed from GitHub GraphQL Tool. The app directory `ghgql` still shows this and this could be renamed sometime.
