## Purpose

This was created to:

- **Explore** the GitHub GraphQL API for fun.
- Output CSV **reports** around repos, users and commits - all within a target GH org or user.
- Act as a **wrapper** on requests and formatting, so you can focus on writing or using a query and getting the data out as a CSV. No Python experience needed if you just use this as a CLI tool.
